    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Tagine is a classic Moroccan dish that takes its name from the earthenware pot it is cooked in. It typically consists of slow-cooked meat (such as chicken, lamb, or beef) or vegetables, combined with a blend of aromatic spices, herbs, and preserved lemons. Tagine dishes are known for their rich flavors and tender textures, often accompanied by couscous or bread.</p>
    <h2>Ingredient:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds lamb meat, cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>1 pinch saffron</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>5 carrots, peeled, cut into fourths, then sliced lengthwise into thin strips</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
        <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can homemade chicken broth or low-sodium canned broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sun-dried tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water (Optional)</li>
      </ul>
      
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place lamb and 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large bowl and toss to coat; set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix together paprika, cinnamon, salt, garlic powder, coriander, cumin, cardamom, ginger, turmeric, cayenne, cloves, and saffron in a large resealable bag. Add lamb to the bag and toss around to coat well. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add 1/3 of the lamb and brown well, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove to a plate and repeat to cook remaining two batches of lamb.</li>
        <li>Add onions and carrots to the pot and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and ginger; continue cooking for an additional 5 minutes. Return lamb to the pot and stir in lemon zest, chicken broth, tomato paste, and honey. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>If the consistency of tagine is too thin, you may thicken it with cornstarch and water slurry during the last 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve over couscous.</li>
      </ol>
